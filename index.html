This site is my development journal of the <a href="">Telescope Histon</a> project. Hopefuly, the information
contained in this site will be of use to anyone interested in creating a
<a href="https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim/tree/master">telescope.nvim</a> plugin.
</p>

<p>
Telescope Histon is a very simple plugin to ease my transition into <a href="https://neovim.io/">neovim</a>. Even though neovim is an awesome editor, its user interface differes greatly from that of a traditional text editor. Two notable use
cases which still give me belly aches are:
</p>
<ul>
  <li> Interactions with language servers </li>
  <li> Interacting with the debuggers </li>
<p>
