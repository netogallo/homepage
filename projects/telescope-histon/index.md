Telescope Histon is a very simple plugin to ease my transition into [https://neovim.io/](neovim). Even though neovim is an awesome editor, its user interface differes greatly from that of a traditional text editor. Two notable use
cases which still give me belly aches are:

- Interactions with language servers
- Interacting with the debuggers
